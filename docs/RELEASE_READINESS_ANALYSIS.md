- **Risk:** The frequency band mapping might feel arbitrary or disconnected
- **Need:** 48-72 hours of real user testing with different music genres
- **Validation:** Can players naturally predict spawns after 10 minutes of play?

### **2. Audio Latency & Synchronization**
**Status: THEORETICAL**
- **Missing:** Real-world latency compensation across devices
- **Critical Issue:** Mobile audio latency ranges 80-200ms, our system assumes 20ms
- **Need:** Device-specific calibration system
- **Validation:** Frame-perfect audio-visual sync testing on 10+ device types

### **3. Music Genre Compatibility**
**Status: SINGLE-CASE DESIGNED**
- **Missing:** Testing with classical, metal, electronic, ambient, speech, etc.

- **Validation:** Playable experience across 20+ diverse audio sources

### **4. Difficulty Curve Reality Check**
**Status: UNTESTED**
- **Missing:** Actual player progression data
- **Risk:** Audio complexity ≠ gameplay difficulty (complex jazz vs. simple EDM)
- **Need:** Separate audio complexity from gameplay challenge
- **Validation:** Can beginners complete a 2-minute session? Can experts be challenged?

### **5. Visual Clarity Under Stress**
**Status: THEORETICAL**
- **Missing:** High-intensity gameplay visibility testing
- **Risk:** 4D visualizations + particles + telegraph warnings = visual chaos
- **Need:** Dynamic UI/particle reduction during high-intensity moments
- **Validation:** Can players distinguish interaction types during busy sequences?
