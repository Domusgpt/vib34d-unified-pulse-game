## 🎯 Quadrant-Based Gameplay System

### Screen Division
```
┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
│  QUADRANT 1 │  QUADRANT 2 │
│   (Melody)  │   (Harmony) │
├─────────────┼─────────────┤
│  QUADRANT 3 │  QUADRANT 4 │
│   (Rhythm)  │   (Bass)    │
└─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Quadrant States
1. **Active** - Normal interaction zone
2. **Charging** - Building energy (visual telegraph)
3. **Danger** - Untappable zone (clear visual warning)
4. **Locked** - Requires specific action to unlock
5. **Bonus** - Enhanced scoring opportunity

### Visual Telegraph System
- **3-second warning** - Subtle color shift and particle gathering
- **2-second warning** - Clear boundary visualization
- **1-second warning** - Intense particle storm and color change
- **Active state** - Unmistakable visual barrier

## 🎨 Geometry-Based Interaction Types

### Tesseract (4D Cube) - "Pulse Targets"
- **Visual Cue:** Rotating wireframe with pulsing core
- **Interaction:** Tap on beat
- **Audio Relation:** Strong beat/downbeat
- **Success Feedback:** Explosive particle burst, haptic pulse
- **Failure Feedback:** Wireframe collapse, muted haptic

### Hypersphere (4D Sphere) - "Flow Targets"
- **Visual Cue:** Flowing energy orb with directional trails
- **Interaction:** Swipe in direction of flow
- **Audio Relation:** Melodic phrases, rising/falling tones
- **Success Feedback:** Trail explosion, flowing haptic wave
- **Failure Feedback:** Energy dissipation, stuttering haptic

### 24-Cell (Complex 4D) - "Precision Targets"
- **Visual Cue:** Complex rotating structure with timing rings
- **Interaction:** Hold until alignment perfect
- **Audio Relation:** Sustained notes, harmonic progression
- **Success Feedback:** Structure locks into perfect symmetry
- **Failure Feedback:** Structure becomes chaotic

### 120-Cell (Most Complex) - "Avoid Zones"
- **Visual Cue:** Menacing dark energy with warning particles
- **Interaction:** Must NOT touch
- **Audio Relation:** Dissonance, noise, aggressive frequencies
- **Success Feedback:** Zone dissipates peacefully
- **Failure Feedback:** Screen crack effect, sharp haptic jolt

## 🔥 Enhanced Visual Feedback Systems

### Success Indicators
1. **Perfect Hit**
   - Geometry explodes into golden particles
   - Screen briefly flashes geometry color
   - Strong haptic confirmation pulse
   - Visualizer parameters surge positively

2. **Good Hit**
   - Geometry fragments into colored particles
   - Moderate particle emission
   - Medium haptic pulse
   - Visualizer responds proportionally

3. **Miss**
   - Geometry fades to grey and dissolves
   - Sad particle drop effect
   - No haptic feedback
   - Visualizer dims slightly

### Combo System Visuals
- **Combo 5:** Particle trails connect between hits
- **Combo 10:** Quadrant borders begin to glow
- **Combo 15:** Cross-quadrant particle bridges
- **Combo 20+:** Full screen particle symphony

### Failure State Clarity
- **Why you failed:** Clear visual indicator (wrong timing, wrong action, avoid zone)
- **What to do next:** Telegraph shows correct interaction type
- **Progress feedback:** Visual combo counter and score display

## ⚡ Particle System Architecture

### Particle Categories

#### 1. Telegraph Particles
- **Warning Swarm** - Gathers before danger zones activate
- **Boundary Stream** - Shows quadrant borders during danger
- **Countdown Pulse** - Rhythmic particles showing timing

#### 2. Interaction Particles
- **Success Burst** - Explosive feedback for correct actions
- **Trail Flow** - Continuous feedback for swipe actions
- **Hold Glow** - Building intensity for sustained actions

#### 3. Ambient Particles
- **Audio Reactive** - Responds to frequency analysis
- **Geometry Aura** - Emanates from 4D shapes
- **Combo Bridge** - Connects successful interactions

#### 4. System Particles
- **Performance** - Adaptive quality based on device capability
- **Pool Management** - Efficient reuse of particle objects
- **Culling** - Remove off-screen particles

### Particle Behaviors

#### Audio-Reactive Properties
```javascript
particleSystem.update({
    beat: audioDirector.getBeatEnergy(),
    frequency: audioDirector.getFrequencyData(),
    tempo: audioDirector.getCurrentBPM(),
    quadrant: quadrantManager.getActiveState()
});
```

#### Quadrant-Based Emission
```javascript
const emissionPattern = {
    quadrant1: { density: 'high', color: 'melody', direction: 'outward' },
    quadrant2: { density: 'medium', color: 'harmony', direction: 'circular' },
    quadrant3: { density: 'pulse', color: 'rhythm', direction: 'vertical' },
    quadrant4: { density: 'low', color: 'bass', direction: 'inward' }
};
```

## 🎛️ Haptic Feedback Integration

### Haptic Patterns
1. **Beat Pulse** - Soft pulse on every beat (helps rhythm learning)
2. **Success Burst** - Sharp, satisfying pulse for correct hits
3. **Warning Vibrate** - Escalating vibration for danger zones
4. **Combo Rhythm** - Pattern that builds with combo count
5. **Spatial Cues** - Different patterns for different quadrants

### Audio-Haptic Sync
- Haptic events triggered by AudioGameplayDirector
- Intensity scaled by audio energy levels
- Pattern variation based on geometry type
